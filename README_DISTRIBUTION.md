# Distribution Archive Contents

The VisualDCT distribution archives are available as zip and tar.gz files
with identical content.

## JARs

**Binaries**, **sources** and **Javadoc** are provided as JARs.

The binary jar is executable. However, VisualDCT can also be started by calling 
`java` with the JAR on the command line - this is shown in `runScript`.

## Documentation

The `site` directory contains the project's complete documentation web site,
consisting of
 * specific **user documentation** (in subdirectory `doc`),
 * the complete **Javadoc** (in `apidocs`),
 * cross-referenced source listings (in `xref`),
 * and project documentation reports.

## Maven POM

The Maven Project Object Model is added for reference.
If you want to build VisualDCT from sources, check out the project from its
[GitHub project](https://github.com/epics-extensions/VisualDCT/).
